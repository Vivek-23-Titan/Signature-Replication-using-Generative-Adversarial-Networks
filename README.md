# Signature-Replication-using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks

This Project focuses on generating signatures along with their labels of 10 different people with the help of CGAN. With the help of a classifier, we can then classify those images as well as see their effects when used as training data for the classifier.

### Dataset
The Dataset consists of 10 different signature, each class having 100 instances.

### Code
The Code is available in the Jupyter notebook.

### Results
The generated and original images are shown below:


The accuracy of Deep Convolutional Classifier trained on generated data and validated on original data is shown below.

### Requirements
